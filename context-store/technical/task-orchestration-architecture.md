# Task Orchestration Architecture
**Reviewed: Not yet reviewed**

## Overview

The Task Orchestration system coordinates task execution across agents in the AI Agent System, managing task assignments, dependencies, and lifecycle states throughout the workflow.

## Core Components

### Task Registry
- Maintains information about available tasks
- Stores task metadata, dependencies, and assignments
- Located in `tasks/` directory as individual YAML files

### Task Metadata System
- Defines tasks with rich metadata
- Supports priority levels, dependencies, and owner assignment
- Enables filtering by various criteria

### Task State Machine
- Tracks task lifecycle states
- Manages transitions between states
- Ensures proper flow through the system

### Task Execution Engine
- Executes tasks through the LangGraph workflow
- Injects appropriate context for each task
- Collects and stores results

## Task Lifecycle States

```
CREATED → PLANNED → IN_PROGRESS → QA_PENDING → DOCUMENTATION → DONE
                                          ↓
                                      REVISIONS
                                          ↑
                                          ↓
                                       FAILED
```

- **CREATED**: Task is defined but not yet ready for execution
- **PLANNED**: Task is ready for execution but not started
- **IN_PROGRESS**: Task is currently being executed
- **QA_PENDING**: Task implementation is complete and awaiting QA
- **REVISIONS**: Task requires modifications based on QA feedback
- **FAILED**: Task execution failed
- **DOCUMENTATION**: Task is being documented
- **DONE**: Task is completed successfully

## Task Definition Format

Tasks are defined in YAML files:

```yaml
# tasks/BE-07.yaml
id: BE-07
title: Implement Customer Service Functions
description: |
  Create service functions for customer data operations
owner: backend_engineer
priority: high
dependencies:
  - BE-03
  - BE-05
status: PLANNED
estimated_hours: 4
```

## Task Execution Flow

1. **Task Selection**: A task is selected for execution based on priority and dependencies
2. **Context Preparation**: Relevant context is retrieved for the task
3. **Workflow Creation**: A LangGraph workflow is created based on task requirements
4. **Agent Assignment**: The task is assigned to appropriate agents
5. **Execution**: The workflow is executed
6. **Result Collection**: Results are collected and stored
7. **State Update**: Task state is updated based on execution outcome

## Task Dependency Management

The system resolves task dependencies automatically:

```python
def get_executable_tasks():
    """Get all tasks that are ready to be executed (dependencies satisfied)."""
    ready_tasks = []
    for task in get_planned_tasks():
        if all(is_completed(dep) for dep in task.dependencies):
            ready_tasks.append(task)
    return ready_tasks
```
