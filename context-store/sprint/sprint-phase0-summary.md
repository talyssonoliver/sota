# Sprint Phase 0 Setup Summary
**Reviewed: Not yet reviewed**

## Key Accomplishments
- Established foundational AI Agent System infrastructure using LangChain, LangGraph, and CrewAI
- Set up environment with required dependencies and configuration templates
- Implemented core MCP (Memory Context Protocol) functionality for knowledge retrieval
- Created A2A (Agent-to-Agent) communication protocol with LangGraph

## Core Components Created
- **Environment**: requirements.txt, .env.template, .gitignore
- **Tools**: memory_engine.py, echo_tool.py, supabase_tool.py
- **Configuration**: agents.yaml, tools.yaml
- **Prompts**: Templates for backend-engineer and coordinator agents
- **Knowledge Base**: Schema summaries and service patterns
- **Testing**: Entry point with component validation

## Success Criteria Met
