# Product Context: AI Agent System for Artesanato E-commerce

## Why This Project Exists

### Problem Statement
Traditional software development for e-commerce platforms requires significant manual coordination between different specialists (backend developers, frontend developers, QA engineers, technical architects, etc.). This leads to:

- **Coordination Overhead**: Manual handoffs between team members slow down development
- **Context Loss**: Knowledge and decisions get lost between team members and phases
- **Inconsistent Quality**: Different team members may have varying approaches to similar problems
- **Bottlenecks**: Dependencies on specific team members can block progress
- **Documentation Gaps**: Manual processes often result in incomplete or outdated documentation

### Solution Vision
Create an intelligent multi-agent system that can automate the coordination and execution of software development tasks, specifically for building an e-commerce platform. Each agent specializes in a particular domain (backend, frontend, QA, etc.) and can work both independently and collaboratively.

## Problems This System Solves

### 1. Development Coordination
- **Before**: Manual task assignment and coordination between team members
- **After**: Automated workflow orchestration with dependency management

### 2. Context Management
- **Before**: Knowledge scattered across team members, documents, and conversations
- **After**: Centralized memory engine that provides relevant context to any agent when needed

### 3. Quality Consistency
- **Before**: Varying approaches and quality standards across team members
- **After**: Standardized patterns and practices enforced through agent prompts and tools

### 4. Documentation
- **Before**: Manual documentation that often becomes outdated
- **After**: Automated documentation generation as part of the development process

### 5. Task Execution
- **Before**: Manual execution of repetitive development tasks
- **After**: Automated execution with intelligent decision-making

## How It Should Work

### User Experience Goals

#### For Development Teams
1. **Simplified Task Management**: Define tasks in YAML format with clear dependencies
2. **Automated Execution**: System handles task coordination and execution automatically
3. **Intelligent Context**: Agents automatically access relevant project knowledge
4. **Quality Assurance**: Built-in QA processes ensure consistent output quality
5. **Comprehensive Reporting**: Detailed reports on task execution and outcomes

#### For Project Stakeholders
1. **Visibility**: Clear progress tracking and status reporting
2. **Predictability**: Consistent execution patterns and timing
3. **Quality**: Reliable, tested outputs from all development tasks
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive, up-to-date project documentation

### Core Workflows

#### 1. Task Definition & Planning
- Tasks defined in YAML with clear specifications
- Dependency mapping ensures proper execution order
- Agent assignment based on task type and requirements

#### 2. Context-Aware Execution
- Memory engine provides relevant context to agents
- Agents make informed decisions based on project history
- Cross-agent communication maintains consistency

#### 3. Quality Assurance
- Automated testing and validation
- QA agent reviews outputs before completion
- Continuous improvement based on feedback

#### 4. Documentation & Reporting
- Automatic generation of technical documentation
- Progress reports and status updates
- Knowledge capture for future reference

## Success Metrics

### Technical Success
- **100% Test Pass Rate**: All system components pass comprehensive testing
- **Zero Security Vulnerabilities**: Memory engine passes security audits
- **Performance Targets**: Sub-second response times for context retrieval
- **Reliability**: 99%+ uptime for agent operations

### Business Success
- **Development Speed**: Faster completion of pre-Sprint 0 tasks
