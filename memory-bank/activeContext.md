2. **Knowledge Expansion**: Add domain-specific context files as needed
3. **Automation Enhancement**: Improve automatic context updates

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Memory Bank Structure
- **Decision**: Use hierarchical file structure with core files building on each other
- **Rationale**: Ensures consistent context flow and prevents information duplication
- **Impact**: Agents can access progressively detailed context based on their needs

### Documentation Approach
- **Decision**: Focus on operational knowledge rather than code documentation
- **Rationale**: Code documentation exists elsewhere; memory bank provides strategic context
- **Impact**: Agents get business and architectural context, not implementation details

### Context Granularity
- **Decision**: Balance between comprehensive context and focused relevance
- **Rationale**: Too much context overwhelms agents; too little provides insufficient guidance
- **Impact**: Each file serves specific context needs without overlap

## Important Patterns & Preferences

### Context Retrieval Patterns
```python
# Agents should request context by topic
context = get_relevant_context(task, agent_topics)

# Topics align with memory bank structure
agent_topics = [
    'system-architecture',    # systemPatterns.md
    'project-goals',         # projectbrief.md + productContext.md
    'technical-stack',       # techContext.md
    'current-status'         # activeContext.md + progress.md
]
```

### Memory Bank Update Triggers
1. **Major System Changes**: Architecture modifications, new components
2. **User Requests**: Explicit "update memory bank" commands
3. **Context Gaps**: When agents lack necessary context for tasks
4. **Performance Issues**: When context retrieval is ineffective

### Quality Standards
- **Accuracy**: All information must reflect current system state
- **Relevance**: Focus on information agents need for decision-making
- **Clarity**: Use clear, technical language without ambiguity
- **Completeness**: Cover all aspects agents might need to understand

## Learnings & Project Insights

### System Evolution
The AI Agent System has matured significantly from its initial conception:
- **Phase 0**: Basic setup and component integration
- **Phase 1**: Agent specialization and workflow development
- **Phase 2**: Security hardening and performance optimization
- **Current**: Production-ready system with comprehensive testing

### Memory Engine Transformation
The memory engine underwent a complete overhaul addressing:
- **Security**: Fixed hash vulnerabilities, implemented PII protection
- **Performance**: Added multi-tier caching and tiered storage
- **Reliability**: Eliminated bugs and improved error handling
- **Monitoring**: Added comprehensive audit logging and health metrics

### Agent Coordination Maturity
The multi-agent system has evolved sophisticated coordination patterns:
- **Specialized Roles**: Each agent has clear domain expertise
- **Context Sharing**: Memory engine provides consistent context across agents
- **Workflow Orchestration**: LangGraph manages complex task dependencies
- **Quality Assurance**: Multi-layer validation ensures output quality

## Context Integration Points

### With Existing System
- **Task Execution**: Memory bank provides context for YAML-defined tasks
- **Agent Operations**: Agents query memory bank for relevant background
- **Workflow Orchestration**: LangGraph uses context for routing decisions
- **Quality Assurance**: QA agents reference standards from memory bank

### With External Tools
- **Supabase Integration**: Database context informs agent operations
- **GitHub Operations**: Repository context guides development decisions
- **Testing Framework**: Test context ensures comprehensive validation
- **Documentation Generation**: Memory bank informs automated documentation

## Current Challenges & Considerations

### Context Relevance
- **Challenge**: Ensuring agents get relevant context without information overload
- **Approach**: Topic-based context retrieval with agent-specific filtering
- **Monitoring**: Track context usage patterns to optimize relevance

### Information Currency
- **Challenge**: Keeping memory bank information current as system evolves
- **Approach**: Trigger-based updates and regular validation cycles
- **Monitoring**: Version tracking and change detection

### Integration Complexity
- **Challenge**: Balancing comprehensive context with system performance
- **Approach**: Tiered context delivery based on agent needs
- **Monitoring**: Performance metrics for context retrieval operations
