# Project Brief: AI Agent System for Artesanato E-commerce

## Project Overview

This project implements a **multi-agent AI system** that automates software development tasks for the Artesanato E-commerce platform. The system leverages specialized agents coordinated through a LangGraph-based workflow engine to complete pre-Sprint 0 development tasks.

## Core Requirements

### Primary Goal
Automate software development tasks using specialized AI agents that can work independently and collaboratively to build an e-commerce platform.

### Key Capabilities Required
1. **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Specialized agents for different roles (Technical Lead, Backend, Frontend, QA, Documentation)
2. **Workflow Orchestration**: LangGraph-based workflow engine with dependency management
3. **Context-Aware Operations**: Vector database (ChromaDB) for intelligent context retrieval
4. **Task Management**: YAML-based task definitions with dependency tracking
5. **Memory & Knowledge Management**: Secure memory engine with PII protection and tiered storage

### Technical Constraints
- Python 3.9+ environment
- OpenAI API integration required
- Must support Windows development environment
- Enterprise-grade security for memory operations
- Production-ready performance with caching and optimization

### Success Criteria
- All agents can execute their specialized tasks independently
- Workflow engine successfully coordinates multi-agent operations
- Memory engine provides relevant context without security vulnerabilities
- System can complete pre-Sprint 0 tasks for e-commerce platform development
- 100% test success rate across all components

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- Multi-agent system architecture
- LangGraph workflow orchestration
- Memory engine with security and performance optimization
- Task execution and dependency management
- Integration with external tools (Supabase, GitHub, etc.)
- Comprehensive testing framework
- Documentation generation

### Out of Scope
- Actual e-commerce platform implementation (handled by agents)
- Manual development processes
- Non-automated testing procedures
- Direct database management (handled through agents)

## Key Stakeholders
- **Primary**: Development team requiring automated software development assistance
- **Secondary**: E-commerce platform stakeholders benefiting from accelerated development

## Timeline Context
- **Current Phase**: Post-Sprint 0 setup, system operational
- **Recent Milestone**: Memory Engine security overhaul completed (December 2024)
- **Status**: Production-ready system with all core components functional
