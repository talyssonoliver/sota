# AI Agent System for Artesanato E-commerce

This project implements a **production-ready multi-agent AI system** that automates end-to-end software development workflows for the Artesanato E-commerce platform. The system orchestrates 7 specialized agents through sophisticated LangGraph workflows, featuring enterprise-grade security, real-time monitoring, and comprehensive automation capabilities.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

**Multi-Agent Orchestration**: 7 specialized agents (Technical Lead, Backend, Frontend, QA, Documentation, Product Manager, UX Designer) work collaboratively through LangGraph workflows with dynamic routing and dependency management.

**Enterprise Memory Engine**: ChromaDB-powered vector database with AES-256 encryption, PII detection, multi-tier caching, and tiered storage (hot/warm/cold) for context-aware operations.

**Workflow Automation**: Complete daily cycle automation with morning briefings, real-time execution monitoring, end-of-day reports, and stakeholder notifications.

**Quality Assurance**: Multi-level QA pipeline with automated testing (Jest/Cypress), code quality analysis, and comprehensive coverage tracking.

## Overview

The system uses specialized agents for different roles (Technical Lead, Backend Engineer, Frontend Engineer, etc.) to complete pre-Sprint 0 tasks. It follows these design principles:

- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: Provides agents with relevant context from the knowledge base
- **A2A (Agent-to-Agent Protocol)**: Enables structured communication between agents
- **LangGraph**: Defines workflows as directed graphs with agents as nodes
- **CrewAI**: Creates role-specialized agents with distinct capabilities
- **Dynamic Workflow**: Adapts to task requirements and dependencies, allowing for flexible execution paths
- **Task Orchestration**: Manages task execution order based on dependencies, ensuring efficient resource utilization
- **LangSmith**: Unifies observation and testing for all agents, providing a consistent interface for monitoring and debugging
- **Tool Loader**: Loads and configures tools for each agent, enabling them to perform specialized tasks
- **Tool Integration**: Connects agents to external tools (e.g., Supabase, GitHub) for enhanced functionality
- **Testing Framework**: Provides a unified test runner for validating agent functionality and system integration
- **Documentation**: Generates comprehensive reports and documentation for each task, ensuring transparency and traceability
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitors task completion and generates reports for each sprint cycle

# Run all tests (quick validation, tool tests, and full suite)
python -m tests.run_tests --all

# Run only the quick validation test (fastest option)
python -m tests.run_tests --quick

# Run only the tool loader tests
python -m tests.run_tests --tools

# Run only the full test suite
python -m tests.run_tests --full

# Show available test options
python -m tests.run_tests --help
```

### Test Components

- **run_tests.py**: Unified test runner with multiple test modes
