- **Risk Levels**: low, medium, high, critical with appropriate escalation paths
- **Escalation Levels**: 4 levels with configured timeouts and recipients
  - **Level 1**: Team Lead Review (2h timeout)
  - **Level 2**: Management Review (6h timeout) 
  - **Level 3**: Director Review (12h timeout)
  - **Level 4**: Executive Review (24h timeout)
- **Timeout Thresholds**: Intelligent timeout handling with different logic for `duration` vs `timeout_hours`

#### Technical Fixes Applied
1. **Timer ID Generation**: Fixed collision issue using microsecond precision
2. **Escalation Level Logic**: Refined timeout thresholds for accurate level determination
3. **Notification System**: Fixed mock patching using dynamic method lookup

5. **CLI Display**: Fixed escalation level property access
6. **QA Task Policies**: Added comprehensive QA task type escalation policies

#### Integration Points
- **HITL Engine**: Automatic escalation on review timeouts and rejections
- **Feedback System**: Captures escalation events as structured feedback
- **CLI Interface**: Manual escalation operations and status management
- **Notification Channels**: Multi-channel dispatch with template rendering
