## 🏗️ COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### Step 7.1 — Define HITL Checkpoints ✅ **IMPLEMENTED (Enhanced)**

**Original Plan:**
HITL moments are inserted at high-risk or subjective junctions:

| Workflow Phase | HITL Trigger |
|---------------|--------------|
| Agent Prompt | Prompt includes ambiguous goal or sensitive logic |
| Output Evaluation | Critical service code or schema changes |
| QA | Test coverage below threshold |
| Documentation | Lacks clarity or human verification required |
| Task Transitions | Move to DONE or merge PR |

Track these triggers in `tasks/BE-07.yaml` under `requires_human_review: true`.

**Status:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED WITH ENHANCEMENTS**
- Enhanced with comprehensive `config/hitl_policies.yaml`
- Advanced policy-driven checkpoint configuration
- Risk-based automation and dynamic thresholds

### Step 7.2 — Human Review Portal or CLI ✅ **IMPLEMENTED (Enhanced)**

**Original Plan:**
```bash
python orchestration/review_task.py BE-07
```

This displays:
- Prompt used by agent
- Output code or response  
- QA findings (pass/fail + metrics)
- Diff from last task
- Checkbox: [✓] Approve for Merge

Could be a CLI tool or web UI (Flask/Vite frontend)

**Status:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED WITH ENHANCEMENTS**
- Enhanced `orchestration/review_task.py` with rich CLI interface
- Multi-modal review capabilities
- Batch processing and interactive workflows

### Step 7.3 — Implement LangGraph Interrupt Nodes ❌ **NOT IMPLEMENTED**

**Original Plan:**
```python
workflow.add_conditional_edges("qa", {
  "passed": "doc",
  "needs_human": "human_checkpoint"
})

# In human_checkpoint node:
# - Pause execution
# - Store agent output in /pending_reviews/
# - Await human input or approval flag

if not os.path.exists(f".approved/{task_id}.flag"):
    return "WAIT"
else:
    return "resume"
```

**Status:** ❌ **NOT IMPLEMENTED AS PLANNED**
- Missing: LangGraph interrupt node implementation
- Missing: `/pending_reviews/` directory system
- Missing: `.approved/{task_id}.flag` file-based approval
- Alternative: HITL Engine Integration implemented instead

### Step 7.4 — Output Feedback Integration ✅ **IMPLEMENTED (Enhanced)**

**Original Plan:**
Allow reviewers to attach feedback to agent runs:
```json
{
  "task": "BE-07",
  "reviewer": "alice", 
  "approved": true,
  "comments": [
    "Consider renaming 'fetchOrders' to 'getOrdersByUserId'.",
    "Great use of Supabase filters."
  ],
  "timestamp": "2025-04-02T18:30Z"
}
```
Saved to: `outputs/BE-07/human_review.json`

**Status:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED WITH ENHANCEMENTS**
- Complete structured feedback integration system
- Analytics and reporting capabilities
- Enhanced feedback collection beyond original scope

### Step 7.5 — Approval Protocols & Enforcement ✅ **IMPLEMENTED (Enhanced)**

**Original Plan:**
Define team policies per task type:

| Task Type | Auto-Approve? | Human Required? |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Design Draft | No | Yes (UX Lead) |
| CI Config | Yes | No |
| Core Code | No | Yes (TL/Eng) |
| Docs | Optional | PM Review |

You can encode these in metadata or use GitHub branch protection + status checks.

**Status:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED WITH ENHANCEMENTS**
- Policy-driven escalation system
- Automated enforcement mechanisms
- Enhanced beyond original scope

### Step 7.6 — Human Agent Roles ✅ **IMPLEMENTED (Enhanced)**

**Original Plan:**
Treat human reviewers as agents in the system:

Define Human Roles:
- Reviewer Agent: Validates prompts/outputs
- Approver Agent: Signs off on transitions  
- Curator Agent: Chooses knowledge base additions
- QA Analyst: Reviews test adequacy

Example YAML:
```yaml
id: UX-02
requires_human_review: true
reviewers:
  - UX Lead
  - Product Manager
```

**Status:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED WITH ENHANCEMENTS**
- Complete human agent integration system
- Role-based assignment and workload tracking
- Performance monitoring and SLA tracking

### Step 7.7 — Escalation & Conflict Resolution ❌ **NOT IMPLEMENTED AS PLANNED**

**Original Plan:**
When a human rejects or flags a task:
- Task state is set to BLOCKED
- Explanation logged
- Coordinator agent adds to "Needs Human Resolution" queue

**Status:** ❌ **NOT IMPLEMENTED AS PLANNED**
- Missing: BLOCKED task state handling
- Missing: "Needs Human Resolution" queue
- Alternative: External API integration & webhooks implemented instead

### Step 7.8 — Feedback Loop for Agent Refinement ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

**Original Plan:**
Aggregate human feedback to:
- Retrain prompt templates
- Adjust retrieval context  
- Improve tool functions

Example:
```bash
python analytics/analyse_feedback.py --task BE-07
```

Outputs:
- Summary of recurring edits
- Prompt modifications needed
- Examples for fine-tuning

**Status:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- Complete feedback analysis and agent refinement system
- `analytics/analyse_feedback.py` with comprehensive analysis capabilities
- Prompt template improvement recommendations based on human feedback
- Context adjustment suggestions based on feedback patterns
- Tool improvement recommendations from user feedback
- Fine-tuning example generation for agent training
