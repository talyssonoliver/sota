# LangGraph Task Orchestration Audit Template

## System Overview
This audit template focuses on the LangGraph orchestration layer of the SOTA Multi-Agent System. LangGraph is used to define workflows as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) where each node represents an agent performing a specific task.

## Key Files to Review
- `graph/flow.py`: Core workflow definitions
- `graph/graph_builder.py`: Constructs the task graph from configuration
- `orchestration/execute_workflow.py`: Executes the workflow with potential dynamic routing
- `config/critical_path.yaml`: Defines the static dependency chain
- `orchestration/inject_context.py`: Handles context injection for agents
- `tools/memory_engine.py`: ChromaDB vector store integration

## Audit Checklist

### 1. Static vs. Dynamic Graph Flow Verification
- [ ] Verified static path follows `critical_path.yaml` strictly
- [ ] Confirmed `--dynamic` flag enables adaptive routing
- [ ] Tested both modes and documented differences
- [ ] Identified any issues with task dependencies
- [ ] Reviewed documentation of flow control logic

### 2. Agent State Transition Analysis
- [ ] Traced context flow between agent transitions
- [ ] Verified proper context isolation between transitions
- [ ] Checked ChromaDB retrieval patterns
- [ ] Tested performance with varying context sizes
- [ ] Reviewed memory scope definitions

### 3. Graph Edge Configuration Assessment
- [ ] Verified edge creation logic in graph builder
- [ ] Checked for potential race conditions
- [ ] Identified any existing conditional branching
- [ ] Reviewed parallelization patterns
- [ ] Tested graph visualization accuracy

## Additional Context
The system's graph orchestration should balance between static determinism (ensuring critical tasks occur in the right order) and dynamic flexibility (allowing adaptive paths when possible). The audit should particularly focus on how the system manages transitions between these modes and how context is preserved/injected.
