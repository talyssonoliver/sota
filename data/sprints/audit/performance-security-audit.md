# Performance and Security Audit Template

## System Overview
This audit template focuses on the performance optimization and security aspects of the SOTA Multi-Agent System, including benchmarking, resource utilization, LLM provider integration, and security measures.

## Key Files to Review
- `graph/resilient_workflow.py`: Retry and error handling
- `tools/memory_engine.py`: Vector database performance
- `.env` and credential handling
- Tool implementation files for security patterns
- LLM provider configuration
- Memory usage monitoring

## Additional Context
Performance and security are critical for production-grade AI systems. Performance concerns include optimizing LLM API usage, memory efficiency, and execution speed. Security considerations include proper handling of credentials, input validation, permission checks, and data privacy. The audit should evaluate both aspects comprehensively.
