# Advanced Enhancements Audit Template

## System Overview
This audit template focuses on advanced features in the SOTA Multi-Agent System, including automatic graph generation, resilience mechanisms, real-time monitoring, and human-in-the-loop integration.

## Key Files to Review
- `graph/auto_generate_graph.py`: Graph auto-generation
- `graph/resilient_workflow.py`: Retry and fallback logic
- `graph/notifications.py`: Notification mechanisms
- `scripts/monitor_workflow.py`: Real-time monitoring
- `scripts/list_pending_reviews.py`: Review queue management
- `scripts/mark_review_complete.py`: Human approval handling
- `scripts/visualize_task_graph.py`: Graph visualization

## Additional Context
Advanced enhancements like auto-generation of workflows, resilience mechanisms, and human-in-the-loop integration transform a basic multi-agent system into a production-ready solution. The audit should focus on how effectively these features enhance reliability, observability, and real-world usability of the system.
