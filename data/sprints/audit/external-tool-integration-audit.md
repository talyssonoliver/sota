## Additional Context
External tool integration is critical for a multi-agent development system, as it allows agents to interact with real-world services. The security and reliability of these integrations are particularly important, as they represent potential attack vectors and failure points. The audit should focus on how the system securely manages these integrations while providing useful capabilities to the agents.
