## Additional Context
The gap analysis focuses on identifying opportunities for improvement rather than existing implementation flaws. It should consider the system's future evolution and identify areas where small changes could yield significant improvements. Particularly important are opportunities to introduce conditional logic (making the system more adaptive) and cross-agent learning (allowing the system to improve over time).
