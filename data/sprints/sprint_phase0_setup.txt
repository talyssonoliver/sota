Phase 0 Setup: Completed Successfully
I've created the foundational structure for our AI Agent System that will help implement the pre-Sprint 0 tasks for the Artesanato E-commerce project. 
This phase 0 setup establishes the core infrastructure using LangChain, LangGraph, and CrewAI.
Files Created

Environment Setup:
ai-system/requirements.txt - Dependencies including LangChain, LangGraph, CrewAI
ai-system/.env.template - Template for API keys and configuration
ai-system/.gitignore - Prevents sensitive files from being committed

Core Components:
ai-system/tools/memory_engine.py - MCP implementation for context retrieval
ai-system/graph/flow.py - A2A protocol with LangGraph for agent communication
ai-system/tools/echo_tool.py - Simple tool for testing agent functionality
ai-system/tools/supabase_tool.py - Tool for database interactions

Agent Configuration:
ai-system/config/agents.yaml - Definitions for all specialized agents
ai-system/config/tools.yaml - Tool configurations and mappings
ai-system/prompts/backend-engineer.md - Prompt template for Backend Engineer
ai-system/prompts/coordinator.md - Prompt template for Coordinator Agent

Knowledge Base:
ai-system/context-store/db/db-schema-summary.md - Database schema information
ai-system/context-store/service-pattern.md - Service layer implementation patterns

System Tests:
ai-system/main.py - Entry point with tests for all components
