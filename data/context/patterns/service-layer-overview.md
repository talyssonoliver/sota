# Service Layer Overview
**Reviewed: Not yet reviewed**

## Introduction

The service layer in the Artesanato E-commerce project provides a consistent interface between the database and the application's API routes. This document serves as an index to the various service layer patterns implemented in the project.

## Pattern Components

The service layer implementation consists of several key pattern components, each documented separately:

1. **[Service Response Pattern](service-response-pattern.md)**
   - Standard response structure
   - Implementation pattern
   - Benefits of consistent responses

2. **[Error Handling Pattern](error-handling-pattern.md)**
   - Error handler function
   - Error object structure
   - Best practices for error handling

3. **[Service CRUD Operations](service-crud-operations.md)**
   - Read operations (getById, getAll)
   - Create operations (create)
   - Update operations (update)
   - Delete operations (remove)
   - Naming conventions

4. **[API Route Integration](api-route-integration.md)**
   - Basic API route pattern
   - HTTP status code mapping
   - Request validation

## Usage Flow

1. Client makes request to Next.js API route
2. API route calls appropriate service function
3. Service function interacts with database via Supabase
4. Service function returns consistent response structure
5. API route maps service response to HTTP response
6. Client receives standardized response

## Service Implementation Example

A typical service module includes:

```typescript
// productService.ts
import { supabaseClient } from '@/lib/supabase';
import { handleError } from '@/lib/error-utils';
import type { Product, NewProduct } from '@/types';

export const ProductService = {
  // Read operations
  getById: async (id: string) => { ... },
  getAll: async (options?: QueryOptions) => { ... },
  
  // Create operations
  create: async (product: NewProduct) => { ... },
  
  // Update operations
  update: async (id: string, updates: Partial<Product>) => { ... },
  
  // Delete operations
  remove: async (id: string) => { ... }
};
```
