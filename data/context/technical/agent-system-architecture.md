# Agent System Architecture
**Reviewed: Not yet reviewed**

## Overview

The agent system is a core component of the AI Agent System architecture that consists of specialized agents for different roles in the software development process.

## Agent Roles

- **Coordinator Agent**: Manages agent collaboration and task delegation, serving as the central orchestrator
- **Technical Architect Agent**: Designs system architecture, makes technology choices, and ensures alignment with requirements
- **Backend Engineer Agent**: Implements server-side functionality, database interactions, and API endpoints
- **Frontend Engineer Agent**: Implements client-side functionality, user interfaces, and interactions
- **Documentation Agent**: Creates and maintains documentation, including API documentation and user guides
- **QA Agent**: Tests the system, identifies bugs, and ensures quality of implementations

## Agent Implementation

Each agent is implemented using CrewAI with specific configurations:

```python
agent = Agent(
    role="Backend Engineer",
    goal="Implement robust API services",
    backstory="You're an experienced backend developer...",
    verbose=True,
    allow_delegation=False,
    tools=[supabase_tool, github_tool],
    # Memory and context configuration
    llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4"),
)
```

## Agent Registry

The Agent Registry maintains agent definitions and provides access to agent instances:

```python
# Example agent registry usage
from orchestration.registry import get_agent_for_task

agent = get_agent_for_task("BE-07")  # Get backend agent for task BE-07
result = agent.run({"task_id": "BE-07", "context": context})
```

## Agent Communication

Agents communicate using the A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol implemented through LangGraph:

1. Agent produces structured output
2. LangGraph passes output to the next agent in workflow
3. Receiving agent processes input and produces its own output
4. Communication flow follows the workflow DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)
