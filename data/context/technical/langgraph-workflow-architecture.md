# LangGraph Workflow Architecture
**Reviewed: Not yet reviewed**

## Overview

The LangGraph Workflow implements the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol and serves as the backbone for agent collaboration in the AI Agent System, defining how agents communicate and the flow of tasks.

## Core Components

### Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
- Defines the workflow as nodes (agents) connected by edges (dependencies)
- Ensures proper sequencing of agent executions
- Supports both static and dynamic workflows

### Node Handlers
- Agent-specific handlers that manage state transitions
- Process inputs and produce outputs for each agent node
- Encapsulate agent-specific logic

### State Management
- Maintains workflow state during execution
- Tracks task status and progress
- Provides context sharing between agents

### Conditional Branching
- Routes tasks based on dynamic conditions
- Supports different execution paths based on agent outputs
- Enables complex decision logic

## Implementation Structure

```python
from langgraph.graph import Graph
from graph.handlers import backend_handler, qa_handler

# Create workflow graph
workflow = Graph()

# Add nodes (agents)
workflow.add_node("backend", backend_handler)
workflow.add_node("qa", qa_handler)

# Add edges (dependencies)
workflow.add_edge("backend", "qa")

# Add conditional branching
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    "qa",
    lambda state: "doc" if state["status"] == "PASSED" else "backend"
)

# Set entry point
workflow.set_entry_point("backend")

# Compile graph
compiled_graph = workflow.compile()
```

## Workflow Types

### Basic Workflow
- Linear execution flow
- Fixed agent sequence
- Predictable dependencies

### Advanced Workflow
- Conditional branching
- Status-based routing
- Complex agent interaction patterns

### Dynamic Workflow
- Runtime-generated based on task requirements
- Adapts to task dependencies
- Built from task metadata

## Execution Flow

1. Task is selected for execution
2. Appropriate workflow is selected or generated
3. Entry point node (typically coordinator) is executed
4. Each agent produces output which determines next node
5. Execution follows the graph until completion
6. Final output is collected and stored

## Integration with Task System

- Task dependencies define graph structure
- Task metadata informs node configuration
- Task status updates during workflow execution
