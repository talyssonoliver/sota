# Automated Symbol Extraction

A simple utility, `scripts/automated_doc_generator.py`, generates minimal documentation for Python modules that are not documented manually. It scans the repository, extracts function and class definitions, and writes a short Markdown file for each module.

## Usage

```bash
python scripts/automated_doc_generator.py docs/autogenerated
```

The script creates an `autogenerated/` directory under `docs/` containing one Markdown file per Python module. Each file lists the classes and top‑level functions along with their line numbers.

This automated pass provides baseline documentation for less critical files and can be re‑run whenever new modules are added.
