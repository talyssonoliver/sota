## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Details

### Policy Normalization Architecture
```python
def _normalize_policy_access(self, *keys):
    """Helper method to access policies with fallback for both config formats"""
    # Production format: hitl_policies.task_type_policies.backend_tasks
    result = self.policies
    try:
        for key in ['hitl_policies'] + list(keys):
            result = result[key]
        return result
    except (KeyError, TypeError):
        pass
    
    # Test format: task_type_policies.backend
    result = self.policies
    try:
        for key in keys:
            result = result[key]
        return result
    except (KeyError, TypeError):
        return {}
```

### Enhanced Risk Assessment Logic
```python
def _assess_risk(self, task_type: str, risk_factors: List[str]) -> RiskLevel:
    # Try both task type formats
    task_policy = self._normalize_policy_access('task_type_policies', task_type)
    if not task_policy:
        simplified_task_type = task_type.replace('_tasks', '')
        task_policy = self._normalize_policy_access('task_type_policies', simplified_task_type)
    
    # Support both risk pattern structures
    risk_assessment = task_policy.get('risk_assessment', {})
    risk_patterns = task_policy.get('risk_patterns', {})
    
    high_risk_patterns = risk_assessment.get('high_risk_patterns', [])
    high_risk_patterns.extend(risk_patterns.get('high', []))
    # ... risk calculation logic
```

### Escalation Policy Access
```python
def _get_escalation_policy(self, risk_level: RiskLevel) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    escalation_policies = self._normalize_policy_access('escalation_policies')
    risk_key = risk_level.value if hasattr(risk_level, 'value') else str(risk_level)
    
    # Try multiple key formats
    policy = escalation_policies.get(risk_key, {})
    if not policy:
        policy = escalation_policies.get(f"{risk_key}_risk", {})
    
    return policy
```
