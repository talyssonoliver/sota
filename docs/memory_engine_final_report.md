**Fix**: Replaced `hash()` with SHA256 cryptographic hashing  
**Impact**: Eliminated collision vulnerabilities across filename generation

### 2. **Missing PII Detection** (Compliance Risk)
**Risk**: PII leakage, GDPR violations, regulatory fines  
**Fix**: Implemented complete `_contains_pii()` method with SecurityManager integration  
**Impact**: Full PII protection and compliance readiness

### 3. **Weak Encryption Implementation**
**Risk**: Data exposure, encryption bypass  
**Fix**: Proper Fernet/AES-GCM encryption with secure key derivation  
**Impact**: Enterprise-grade encryption for all data at rest and in transit

### 4. **Enterprise Key Management**
**Risk**: Production systems need robust key management  
**Fix**: Multi-provider support (Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)  
**Impact**: Production-ready key management with enterprise integration

### 5. **Input Sanitization Gaps**
**Risk**: Injection attacks, XSS vulnerabilities  
**Fix**: Comprehensive input sanitization with SecurityManager  
**Impact**: Complete protection against injection attacks

## üêõ Critical Bugs Fixed

### 1. **Core Retrieval Flow Bug**
**Issue**: Fallback logic bypassing encryption and proper storage  
**Fix**: Corrected retrieval flow to always use encrypted storage mechanisms  
**Impact**: Reliable and secure context retrieval

### 2. **Semantic Chunking Overlap Logic**
**Issue**: Artificial concatenation instead of proper sliding window  
**Fix**: Implemented proper word-based sliding window with correct step calculations  
**Impact**: Better context continuity and chunk quality

### 3. **Vector Store Deletion Implementation**
**Issue**: Placeholder implementation preventing proper cleanup  
**Fix**: Added ChromaDB document deletion by ID with proper error handling  
**Impact**: Functional secure deletion and data lifecycle management

### 4. **PII Scanning Performance**
**Issue**: Inefficient approach decrypting all content  
**Fix**: Two-pass metadata-based targeting for selective decryption  
**Impact**: Significantly improved performance while maintaining security

### 5. **PartitionManager Configuration**
**Issue**: Missing `partitioning_strategy` config causing runtime errors  
**Fix**: Added complete configuration structure to MemoryEngineConfig  
**Impact**: Stable partition management without runtime failures

## ‚ö° Performance Optimizations
