## API Reference

### Initializing the Memory Engine

```python
from tools.memory_engine import MemoryEngine, MemoryEngineConfig, StorageConfig, CacheConfig

# Production configuration
config = MemoryEngineConfig(
    collection_name="agent_memory",
    knowledge_base_path="context-store/",
    embedding_model="text-embedding-3-small",
    cache=CacheConfig(
        l1_size=512,
        l2_size=4096,
        ttl_seconds=3600,
        enable_analytics=True
    ),
    storage=StorageConfig(
        hot_tier_size=1024,
        warm_tier_size=8192,
        auto_migrate=True
    ),
    security_options={
        "sanitize_inputs": True,
        "encryption_key": "your-secure-key"
    }
)

memory = MemoryEngine(config)
```

### Storing Context (Secure)

```python
# Secure context storage with metadata and access control
memory.add_document(
    filepath="context-store/technical/architecture.md",
    user="admin",
    metadata={
        "type": "architecture",
        "domain": "backend",
        "sensitivity": "internal"
    }
)
```

### Retrieving Context via Vector Search

```python
# Advanced context retrieval with caching and security
context = memory.get_context(
    query="What database system does the platform use?",
    k=3,
    user="agent_user",
    filters={"domain": "backend", "type": "architecture"},
    similarity_threshold=0.75
)
```

### Retrieving Context via Key-Based Lookup

```python
# Direct document access by keys
context = memory.get_context_by_keys(
    keys=["db-schema", "service-pattern"],
    user="agent_user"
)
```

### Context Search with Advanced Filtering

```python
# Multi-domain context search with metadata filtering
search_results = memory.get_context_by_domains(
    domains=["backend", "database"],
    query="authentication system",
    max_results=5,
    user="system"
)
```

### Secure Operations

```python
# Secure deletion with audit trail
success = memory.secure_delete(
    key="sensitive_document_key",
    user="admin"
)

# PII scanning and compliance
flagged_keys = memory.scan_for_pii(user="compliance_officer")

# System health monitoring
health_stats = memory.get_health_stats()
profiler_data = memory.get_profiler_stats()
```

### Bulk Loading Context

```python
memory.load_directory("context-store/backend/")
```

## Integration with Agents

The Memory Engine is integrated with agents to provide relevant context during task execution.

### Vector-Based Integration

```python
# Inside an agent's execution
def execute_task(self, task):
    context = self.memory.retrieve_context(f"Information about {task}")
    # Use context to inform the agent's response
    return self.generate_response(task, context)
```

### Key-Based Integration (New)

```python
# Using the new key-based context retrieval
from tools.memory_engine import get_context_by_keys

def create_backend_engineer_agent(context_keys=None):
    if context_keys is None:
        context_keys = ["db-schema", "service-pattern"]
        
    # Get MCP context directly from specified document keys
    mcp_context = get_context_by_keys(context_keys)
    
    return Agent(
        role="Supabase Engineer",
        goal="Implement robust API services",
        system_prompt=load_and_format_prompt(
            "prompts/backend-agent.md", 
            context=mcp_context
        )
    )
```

## Memory Structure

The Memory Engine organizes information in two main ways:

1. **Vector Database**
   - Content: The actual information to be stored
   - Embeddings: Vector representations of the content
   - Metadata: Additional information about the content (source, type, etc.)
   - Timestamps: When the information was added or updated

2. **File-Based Documents** (New)
   - Stored in the `context-store/` directory
   - Named with meaningful keys (e.g., `db-schema-summary.md`, `service-pattern.md`)
   - Accessed directly by key through `get_context_by_keys()` function
   - Primarily in Markdown format for human readability

## Directory Structure

```
context-store/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ \db\db-schema-summary.md          # Database schema information
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ service-pattern.md     # Backend service patterns
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ component-patterns.md  # Frontend component patterns
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ testing-strategy.md    # QA testing strategies
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

## Optimizations

The Memory Engine includes several optimizations:

1. **Caching**: Frequently accessed context is cached for faster retrieval
2. **Chunking**: Large documents are split into smaller chunks for more precise retrieval
3. **Semantic Reranking**: Results are reranked based on semantic relevance to the query
4. **Context Windowing**: Only the most relevant context is included in responses
5. **Direct Document Access**: Bypasses vector search for known document keys, improving performance
6. **Task-Specific Context**: Only provides context relevant to the specific task domain

## Best Practices

1. **Use Key-Based Retrieval When Possible**: For known document types, use direct key access
2. **Organize by Domain**: Store context documents in domain-specific categories
3. **Be Specific in Queries**: When using vector search, be as specific as possible
4. **Include Metadata**: Add metadata to context to enable filtering
5. **Update Regularly**: Keep the knowledge base updated with the latest information
6. **Monitor Usage**: Track which contexts are most frequently retrieved to optimize the knowledge base
7. **Keep Documents Focused**: Each document should focus on a specific topic or domain

## Configuration

The Memory Engine can be configured through the following parameters:

- `knowledge_base_path`: Path to the knowledge base directory
- `embedding_model`: Model to use for generating embeddings
- `similarity_threshold`: Minimum similarity score for context retrieval
- `chunk_size`: Size of chunks for splitting documents
- `chunk_overlap`: Overlap between chunks
- `cache_size`: Size of the context cache
