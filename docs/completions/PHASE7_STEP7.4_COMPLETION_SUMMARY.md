## 🏗️ SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### Feedback Categories (Weighted Scoring)
```python
code_quality: 25%    - Code structure, best practices, maintainability
architecture: 20%    - System design, patterns, scalability
security: 25%        - Security considerations, vulnerabilities
performance: 15%     - Efficiency, optimization, resource usage
documentation: 15%   - Clarity, completeness, accuracy
```

### Data Flow
```
1. Feedback Collection → FeedbackEntry (validation)
2. Storage → FeedbackStorage (JSON persistence)
3. Analytics → FeedbackAnalytics (trend analysis)
4. HITL Integration → Checkpoint approval workflows
5. Export → Multiple formats (JSON/CSV/Markdown)
```

### Integration Points
```
- HITL Engine: Checkpoint approval/rejection workflows
- CLI Interface: Interactive feedback capture and reporting
- API Endpoints: RESTful feedback operations

# - Approval rates by category
# - Trend analysis over time
# - Common issue identification
# - Reviewer performance metrics
```

### 3. Data Export
```bash
# Export feedback data
python -m cli.feedback_cli export json exports/feedback_data.json --period 7d

# Supports multiple formats:
# - JSON: Structured data export
# - CSV: Spreadsheet-compatible format
# - Markdown: Human-readable summary reports
```

### 4. HITL Integration
```python
# API endpoint integration
POST /api/hitl/checkpoints/{checkpoint_id}/feedback
{
    "reviewer": "reviewer@company.com",
    "categories": {
        "code_quality": {"score": 8, "comments": "Well structured"},
        "security": {"score": 9, "comments": "Secure implementation"}
    },
    "approved": true
}

# Captures feedback AND processes HITL approval decision
