# PHASE 2 Implementation Checklist

This document tracks the implementation progress of PHASE 2 (Task Planning & Workflow Architecture) for the AI Agent System.

## Core LangGraph Implementation Tasks

### Agent-to-Agent Communication
- [x] All agents mapped as LangGraph nodes
  - Implemented in `graph/graph_builder.py` with multiple workflow builder functions
  - Basic implementation in `build_workflow_graph()`
  - Advanced implementation in `build_advanced_workflow_graph()`
  - Dynamic implementation in `build_dynamic_workflow_graph(task_id)`
- [x] Edges created for agent communication (A2A protocol)
  - Connections established in all graph builder functions
  - Conditional edges based on task status
  - Automatic edge generation from dependencies in `critical_path.json`/`critical_path.yaml`
- [x] Standard handlers created for each agent type
  - Located in `graph/handlers.py`
  - Includes coordinator, technical, backend, frontend, qa, documentation, and human_review handlers

### Task Metadata & State Management
- [x] Task metadata and dependencies defined
  - Task schema in `tasks/task-schema.json`
  - YAML files for individual tasks (e.g., `tasks/TL-04.yaml`)
  - Task dependencies tracked in YAML files and `agent_task_assignments.json`
- [x] Conditional branching rules implemented
  - Status-based routing in `build_advanced_workflow_graph()`
  - Task type-based routing (BE-, FE-, TL- prefixes)
  - QA result-based routing (pass/fail paths)

### Context Management & Execution
- [x] MCP-powered memory passed into agents
  - Memory engine integration in agent state
  - Context topics defined in task YAML files
  - Context retrieval from `context-store/`
- [x] Task orchestration CLI operational
  - Command-line interface in `orchestration/execute_workflow.py`
  - Support for executing single tasks, all tasks, or filtered tasks
  - Support for custom output directories

### Visualization & Monitoring
- [x] Graph visualization ready for inspection
  - Mermaid diagram in `graph/critical_path.mmd`
  - HTML rendering in `graph/critical_path.html`
  - Visualization utility in `graph/visualize.py`
  - Multiple visualization formats (basic, advanced, dynamic workflows)

## Enhancement Tasks

### Workflow Automation
- [x] Auto-generate LangGraph based on tasks.json dependencies
  - Implementation in `graph/auto_generate_graph.py`
  - Scans all task YAML files to extract dependencies and generate workflow
  - Auto-configures edges based on task relationships
  - Dynamic node creation based on task owners (agents)

### Resilience & Monitoring
- [x] Add retries or timeout edges
  - Implementation in `graph/resilient_workflow.py`
  - Retry decorator with configurable max retries and delay
  - Timeout decorator for long-running operations
  - Automatic state updates on failure/timeout
  - Error handling and graceful degradation

### Notifications & Logging
- [x] Integrate Slack notifications per node execution
  - Implementation in `graph/notifications.py`
  - Configurable notification levels (all, errors, completion, state changes)
  - Well-formatted Slack messages with task details
  - Fallback to local logging when Slack webhook is not available

### Real-time Monitoring
- [x] Write a CLI to monitor graph runs in real-time
  - Implementation in `scripts/monitor_workflow.py`
  - Interactive curses-based UI with color-coded status display
  - Live event log with real-time updates
  - File watching to detect changes in output directory
  - Support for monitoring specific tasks or all tasks
  - Simple console mode for environments without curses support

## Testing & Validation

- [x] Unit tests for graph builder functions
  - Implemented in `tests/test_enhanced_workflow.py`
  - Tests for basic workflow execution
  - Tests for auto-generated workflows
  - Tests for resilient workflows with retry logic
  - Tests for notification system integration
- [ ] Integration tests for workflows
- [ ] Validation of state transitions
- [ ] Performance benchmarks for different workflow types

## Documentation

- [x] LangGraph workflow documentation (`docs/langgraph_workflow.md`)
- [x] Graph visualization documentation (`docs/graph_visualization.md`)
- [x] CLI usage examples and documentation
  - Documentation in `docs/workflow_monitoring.md`
  - Usage examples for monitoring CLI
  - Usage examples for enhanced workflow executor
- [x] Notification system documentation
  - Documentation in `docs/workflow_monitoring.md`
  - Slack notification configuration details
  - Notification levels explained
  - Integration examples provided

## Next Steps

1. Complete remaining test coverage
2. Conduct performance testing for different workflow types
3. Integrate the enhancements with production workflow execution pipeline
4. Consider extending the monitoring UI with a web-based dashboard
