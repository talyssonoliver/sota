# ChromaDB Telemetry Fix

This directory contains fixes for issues with the ChromaDB library's telemetry component.

## Issue Description

ChromaDB's telemetry system tries to import `is_in_colab` from the main chromadb package, but in some versions of the library, this function is not properly exported in the package's `__init__.py`.

## Solutions

### 1. Environment Variable Solution (Recommended)

The simplest solution is to disable ChromaDB telemetry by setting the following environment variable:

```bash
ANONYMIZED_TELEMETRY=False
```

This has been added to the project's pytest.ini file, so tests should run without issues.

## 2. Manual Patch

In case the environment variable solution doesn't work, you can apply the direct patch to the ChromaDB library:

1. Open the file: `.venv\Lib\site-packages\chromadb\telemetry\product\events.py`
2. Find the `ClientStartEvent` class
3. Modify the `__init__` method to handle import errors:

```python
def __init__(self) -> None:
    super().__init__()
    # Lazy import to avoid circular imports
    try:
        from chromadb import is_in_colab
        self.in_colab = is_in_colab()
    except ImportError:
        # Default to False if the function is not available
        self.in_colab = False
```

## Notes

If you're experiencing issues with the memory_engine tests:
1. Try running them with the batch file
2. If that doesn't work, apply the manual patch
3. As a last resort, consider upgrading or downgrading the ChromaDB package version
