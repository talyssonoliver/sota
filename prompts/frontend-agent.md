## Component Structure Reference
```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { cn } from '@/lib/utils';

interface ComponentProps {
  // Props definition
}

export function Component({ 
  // Destructured props
  className,
  ...props
}: ComponentProps) {
  // Implementation
  return (
    <div className={cn('base-classes', className)} {...props}>
      {/* Component content */}
    
  );
}
```

## Output Format
Begin your response with a summary of the UI component or feature you're implementing. Then provide the full implementation code with proper TypeScript typing. Include any styling code needed. Finish with notes on usage, any potential optimizations, and how this fits into the broader UI architecture.
