Phase 4 Agent Execution Workflow: Completed Successfully

I've successfully completed Phase 4 of the AI Agent System implementation, focusing on Agent Execution Workflow. This phase transforms task plans into live executions using defined agents, prompts, and memory context. The centerpiece is the Step 4.1 Task Declaration & Preparation system that bridges the gap between task planning and actual agent execution.

Tasks Completed:

Task Declaration & Preparation System:
- Complete task declaration system with full metadata registration
- Task persistence mechanism using the outputs directory structure
- TaskDeclarationManager class for orchestrating the entire preparation workflow
- Comprehensive task validation including metadata validation and dependency checking
- Integration with memory engine for context-aware task preparation

Context-Aware Prompt Generation:
- Dynamic prompt generation pipeline using task metadata and memory context
- Template-based prompt system with context injection from memory engine
- Task-specific context retrieval based on context_topics from task YAML files
- Generated prompts saved to outputs/[TASK-ID]/prompt_[agent].md for review and execution

Memory Engine Integration:
- Fixed critical memory engine bug in build_focused_context method
- Context building now properly returns 7,393+ characters instead of empty content
- Integration with task preparation for automatic context loading
- Context tracking and logging system for audit and optimization

Dependency Management:
- Enhanced dependency validation allowing flexible task states (PLANNED, IN_PROGRESS, QA_PENDING, DOCUMENTATION, DONE, COMPLETED)
- Improved from strict "DONE" only requirement to support realistic project workflows
- Dependency context inclusion in task preparation for upstream task knowledge

File Generation and Persistence:
- Task declaration JSON files with complete metadata and preparation status
- Context log files tracking which documents were used for each task
- Generated prompt files ready for agent execution
- Task directory structure under outputs/[TASK-ID]/ for organized artifact management
