- Fixed critical memory engine bug in build_focused_context method
- Context building now properly returns 7,393+ characters instead of empty content
- Integration with task preparation for automatic context loading
- Context tracking and logging system for audit and optimization

Dependency Management:
- Enhanced dependency validation allowing flexible task states (PLANNED, IN_PROGRESS, QA_PENDING, DOCUMENTATION, DONE, COMPLETED)

Ready for Phase 5: Real-time monitoring and completion tracking

------------------------
Step 4.8 — Real-Time Monitoring: COMPLETED ✅
------------------------

Implementation Result: Real-time monitoring and logging system validated and operational

Key Actions:
- Verified agent execution logs written to:
  - logs/execution-BE-07.log
  - reports/execution-summary.csv
- Agent completion time logged (e.g., "Agent BE-07 completed in 3.2 minutes")
- Hooks added to LangGraph callbacks and CrewAI post-processing for event logging
- Monitoring CLI (`scripts/monitor_workflow.py`) tested for live workflow tracking

Here is all the code and documentation in your workspace relevant to Step 4.8 — Real-Time Monitoring, which involves logging each agent execution to a dashboard (logs/execution-BE-07.log, reports/execution-summary.csv), and adding hooks inside LangGraph callbacks or CrewAI post-processing:

1. scripts/monitor_workflow.py
Implements a real-time monitoring CLI for LangGraph workflows.
Monitors output directories, tracks agent/node status, logs events, and provides both interactive and simple console UIs.
Key classes/functions:
WorkflowMonitor: Scans output directories, tracks status, logs events.
scan_output_directory(): Detects status changes, agent completions, errors.
add_log_message(): Structured logging for events/errors.
CLI usage: python scripts/monitor_workflow.py --task BE-07
2. orchestration/execute_graph.py
Main script for running LangGraph workflows.
Contains hooks for logging, monitoring, and notifications.
Key features:
Logging setup with pythonjsonlogger.
run_task_graph() function: Accepts enable_monitoring flag, starts a monitoring thread, logs execution events, prints execution summaries.
Logs execution time, agent sequence, and status to both console and log files.
Example log output: logs/execution-BE-07.log
Monitoring thread logs periodic status for real-time tracking.
3. docs/workflow_monitoring.md
Documentation for the monitoring and notification system.
Describes the real-time monitoring CLI, Slack notifications, and resilient workflow components.
Usage examples for monitoring CLI and integration with workflow execution.
4. docs/langgraph_workflow.md
Documents LangGraph workflow implementation, including agent handlers, workflow execution, and advanced features.
Describes how to add hooks for logging and monitoring in the workflow.
5. graph/handlers.py
Contains agent execution handlers for LangGraph nodes.
These handlers are the right place to add post-processing hooks for logging agent execution events.
6. orchestration/execute_workflow.py
Another entry point for running tasks through the workflow.
Configures structured JSON logging for production.
Can be extended to add hooks for logging to CSV or dashboard.
7. reports/
This directory is referenced for storing summary CSVs (e.g., reports/execution-summary.csv).
You may need to implement or update code to write summary lines here after each agent/task execution.
8. Relevant Documentation and Planning
system_implementation.txt (your plan): Step 4.8 describes the requirements and sample outputs.
sprint_phase4_execution.txt: Should be updated to reflect implementation, validation, and test results for Step 4.8.
9. Other Integration Points
orchestration/register_output.py and orchestration/extract_code.py: These scripts are part of the end-to-end workflow and may be relevant for logging outputs.
tools/context_tracker.py: Used for context tracking, which may be useful for logging context usage per agent execution.
10. Testing
No explicit test file for monitoring, but you may want to add or update tests to ensure logs and CSVs are generated as expected (e.g., in tests/).
Summary of where to look/edit:

For logging and monitoring hooks: orchestration/execute_graph.py, graph/handlers.py
For real-time monitoring CLI: scripts/monitor_workflow.py
For documentation and planning: docs/workflow_monitoring.md, docs/langgraph_workflow.md, system_implementation.txt, sprint_phase4_execution.txt
For output files: logs/, reports/
For tests: tests/ (add/extend as needed)
