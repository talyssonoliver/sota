Phase 3 Knowledge Repository: Completed Successfully
I've implemented the knowledge context system using Model Context Protocol (MCP) for the Artesanato E-commerce project. This phase establishes the knowledge organization and retrieval infrastructure required by all agents in the system.

------------------------
Key Accomplishments
------------------------

1. Created Two-Tiered Knowledge Management System:
   - context-source/ directory contains original source documents
   - context-store/ directory contains processed, agent-optimized summaries
   - Organized in domain-specific subdirectories (db, infra, design, patterns, sprint, technical)

2. Implemented Document Granularity Best Practices:
   - Larger concepts broken down into focused files (e.g., service-layer-pattern.md → service-response-pattern.md, error-handling-pattern.md, etc.)
   - Cross-references between related documents
   - Consistent formatting with title, review status, and sections
   - Attribution and review markers in all summaries

3. Developed Automated Summary Generation Workflow:
   - Added scan_and_summarize method to memory_engine.py
   - Implemented domain inference from filenames and directories
   - Added automated index generation for vector search
   - Ensured "Reviewed: Not yet reviewed" status markers on all summaries

4. Created Knowledge Review System:
   - Implemented manage_knowledge_reviews.py script for review management
   - Defined domain expert responsibility matrix
   - Added automated tracking of review status

   - Summaries stored in corresponding context-store/ subdirectories
   - Vector embeddings created for semantic search

2. Review System Implementation:
   - manage_knowledge_reviews.py identifies summaries needing review
   - Domain experts can view summaries with the 'show' command
   - Summaries can be marked as reviewed with the 'review' command
   - Review status tracked in reviews/knowledge_review_log.csv

3. Maintenance Protocol:
   - Changes to source documents trigger regeneration of summaries
   - Review status reset to "Not yet reviewed" when changed
   - Monthly audit scheduled to ensure summaries remain current

------------------------
Knowledge Retrieval Implementation
------------------------

Two primary retrieval mechanisms implemented:

1. Vector-Based Retrieval:
   ```python
   context = memory.retrieve_context(
       query="What authentication system does the platform use?",
       n_results=3
   )
   ```

2. Key-Based Direct Document Retrieval:
   ```python
   context = memory.get_context_by_keys(["db-schema", "service-pattern"])
   ```

------------------------

PHASE 3 — Knowledge Context with MCP: Detailed Implementation & Completion
------------------------

Summary:
Phase 3 focused on building a robust, context-aware knowledge system for all agents, leveraging the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and advanced retrieval techniques. All planned steps have been fully implemented, tested, and verified.

------------------------
Step-by-Step Achievements
------------------------

Step 3.1 — Create the Knowledge Repository
    • Established `context-source/` for raw documents and `context-store/` for processed, agent-optimized summaries.
    • Organized all knowledge into domain-specific subdirectories (db, infra, design, patterns, sprint, technical).
    • Ensured all key project knowledge is present, categorized, and cross-referenced.

Step 3.2 — Index Knowledge with Vector Embeddings
    • Implemented Chroma vector store with OpenAIEmbeddings in `tools/memory_engine.py`.
    • All summaries in `context-store/` are indexed and embedded for semantic search.
    • Automated index generation and update workflow ensures new/changed documents are always available for retrieval.

Step 3.3 — Implement Retrieval Chain
    • Integrated RetrievalQA and ConversationalRetrievalChain in the memory engine.
    • Provided both vector-based and key-based retrieval APIs for agents and orchestration.
    • Retrieval chains are accessible via `memory.get_context`, `memory.get_context_by_keys`, and related methods.
    • Retrieval supports dynamic k, similarity threshold, and token budget for adaptive, relevant context.

Step 3.4 — Connect MCP Context to Agents
    • All agent builders (backend, frontend, QA, doc, coordinator, etc.) now inject context from the MCP memory engine.
    • Context is dynamically retrieved using `get_context_by_domains`, `get_context_by_keys`, or task-specific queries.
    • The orchestration layer ensures every agent receives the most relevant context for each task, based on metadata or explicit context topics.
    • Context is injected into agent prompts or state, enabling knowledge-grounded, context-aware outputs.
    • Extensive integration and unit tests confirm that context is always injected, used, and influences agent behavior as intended.
    • The system supports fallback and error handling for context retrieval, ensuring robustness even in edge cases.

------------------------
Technical Highlights
------------------------

• Modular, production-ready memory engine with multi-tiered caching, adaptive retrieval, semantic chunking, and tiered storage.
• Security features: input sanitization, encryption, access control, audit logging, and data lifecycle management.
• Automated summary generation and review workflow, with domain inference and review status tracking.
• Agents and orchestration are decoupled from storage details, relying on a unified context API.
• All retrieval and context injection logic is fully covered by tests, with test-specific fallbacks and mocks for CrewAI and LangChain dependencies.
• Logging and test output are streamlined for clarity and maintainability.

------------------------
Verification & Testing
------------------------

• All integration and unit tests for memory, context formatting, agent builder, and CrewAI dependencies pass.
• Test suite covers:
    - Vector and key-based retrieval
    - Context injection into agents
    - Orchestration and task execution with context
    - Error handling and fallback logic
    - CrewAI prompt and i18n compatibility
• Test logs are clean and focused, ensuring easy identification of issues.
