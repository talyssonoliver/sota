## Test Execution Commands

```powershell
# Run all tests (recommended before every commit)
python -m pytest

# Run only Step 4.2 prompt generation tests
python -m pytest tests/test_step_4_2_prompt_generation.py -v

# Run only Step 4.3 LangGraph workflow tests
python -m pytest tests/test_step_4_3_langgraph_workflow.py -v

# Run both Step 4.2 and 4.3 tests with coverage
python -m pytest tests/test_step_4_2_prompt_generation.py tests/test_step_4_3_langgraph_workflow.py --cov=orchestration

# Run integration tests for Step 4.2 and 4.3
python -m pytest tests/test_step_4_2_prompt_generation.py::TestStep42Integration tests/test_step_4_3_langgraph_workflow.py::TestStep43Integration -v
```

## Pre-commit Checklist

git status

# Review diff (optional)
git diff

# Commit using conventional commit message
# Example: test(langgraph): add dry run and CLI interface tests for Step 4.3
# Example: fix(tests): ensure mock state includes all required keys for dry run
# Example: chore(tests): update sprint_phase4_execution.txt with test checklist

git commit -m "test(langgraph): ensure Step 4.3 workflow and CLI interface are fully tested and passing"
