# CrewAI Integration Audit Template

## System Overview
This audit template focuses on how the SOTA Multi-Agent System implements CrewAI for agent role specialization and team collaboration. CrewAI provides the framework for creating specialized agents with distinct responsibilities, capabilities, and toolsets.

## Key Files to Review
- `config/agents.yaml`: Agent role and capability definitions
- `agents/backend.py`: Backend Engineer agent implementation
- `agents/frontend.py`: Frontend Engineer agent implementation
- `agents/technical.py`: Technical Lead agent implementation
- `agents/qa.py`: QA Engineer agent implementation
- `agents/doc.py`: Documentation agent implementation
- `agents/coordinator.py`: Coordinator agent implementation (delegation logic)
- `tools/tool_loader.py`: Tool assignment and configuration

## Audit Checklist

### 1. Role-Based Agent Configuration Assessment
- [ ] Verified each agent has clear, distinct responsibilities
- [ ] Checked role definitions in `agents.yaml` match implementations
- [ ] Confirmed proper separation of concerns

### 4. Agent Prompt Quality Assessment

## Additional Context
CrewAI's value comes from enabling distinct, specialized agents to work together as a team, each with clear responsibilities and capabilities. The audit should evaluate how effectively the system implements this paradigm, particularly examining whether agents stay within their domains or overlap excessively. The coordinator agent's role in orchestration and the mechanisms for inter-agent communication are particularly important.
