# Code Architecture Quality Audit Template

## System Overview
This audit template evaluates the architectural quality of the SOTA Multi-Agent System codebase, focusing on modularity, adherence to the Open/Closed Principle (OCP), configuration management, and avoidance of hardcoded values.

## Key Files to Review
- Overall directory structure
- `config/` directory: Configuration files and schemas
- `tools/memory_engine.py`: Memory abstraction
- `prompts/utils.py`: Prompt management
- `.env` and environment handling
- `_FILE_RELATIONSHIPS.json`: Code relationship documentation
- Registry and factory mechanisms

## Audit Checklist

### 1. Component Modularity Assessment
- [ ] Verified clear separation between components (agents, tools, orchestration)
- [ ] Checked import patterns for proper dependencies
- [ ] Tested component isolation (can one component be modified without breaking others?)
- [ ] Reviewed abstraction boundaries between layers
- [ ] Verified consistent interface patterns

#### Observations

### 2. Configuration Isolation Audit
- [ ] Verified YAML configurations drive behavior rather than hardcoded values
- [ ] Tested adding a new agent without code modifications
- [ ] Tested adding a new tool without code modifications
- [ ] Checked schema validation implementation
- [ ] Reviewed configuration loading patterns

- [ ] Tested environment variable overrides
- [ ] Checked for sensitive information exposure

### 5. Code Extensibility Verification
- [ ] Tested adding a new task type
- [ ] Verified registry pattern implementation
- [ ] Checked factory pattern usage
- [ ] Reviewed plugin architecture (if applicable)
- [ ] Evaluated dependency injection patterns

#### Observations

## Additional Context
A high-quality architecture in an AI agent system allows for extending functionality without modifying existing code (OCP), keeps components loosely coupled, and avoids hardcoded values in favor of configuration. The audit should particularly focus on how the system manages to keep agent logic separate from orchestration logic and how configuration drives behavior.
