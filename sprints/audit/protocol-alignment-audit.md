# Protocol Alignment Audit Template

## System Overview
This audit template evaluates how well the SOTA Multi-Agent System aligns with established multi-agent protocols, specifically the Model-Context-Protocol (MCP) for context management and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) for communication patterns.

## Key Files to Review
- `tools/memory_engine.py`: ChromaDB vector store integration
- `graph/flow.py`: Agent communication flow
- `orchestration/inject_context.py`: Context injection
- `config/agents.yaml`: Agent capability definitions
- `tools/tool_loader.py`: Tool assignment

## Additional Context
MCP (Model-Context-Protocol) and A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocols establish best practices for AI agent systems. MCP focuses on providing relevant context to agents from a centralized store, while A2A establishes communication patterns between specialized agents. Alignment with these protocols enhances interoperability, security, and clarity in multi-agent systems.
