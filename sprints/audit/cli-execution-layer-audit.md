# CLI Tooling and Execution Layer Audit Template

## System Overview
This audit template focuses on the command-line interface (CLI) tools and execution layer of the SOTA Multi-Agent System, which provide the operational control for running and managing the multi-agent workflows.

## Key Files to Review
- `orchestration/execute_task.py`: Individual task execution
- `orchestration/execute_workflow.py`: DAG workflow execution
- `orchestration/daily_cycle.py`: Daily operations management
- `scripts/visualize_task_graph.py`: Graph visualization
- `scripts/monitor_workflow.py`: Execution monitoring
- `scripts/list_pending_reviews.py`: Review management
- `scripts/mark_review_complete.py`: Human approval handling
- `graph/resilient_workflow.py`: Error handling and retry logic

## Additional Context
The CLI tools and execution layer are critical to the system's operability, providing the means for developers and operators to control and monitor the multi-agent workflow. The audit should focus on usability, robustness, and visibility, ensuring that the tools provide clear feedback and helpful error messages, and that the workflow engine handles failures gracefully.
