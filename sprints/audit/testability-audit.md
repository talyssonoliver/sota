# Testability Audit Template

## System Overview
This audit template evaluates the testability of the SOTA Multi-Agent System, focusing on unit tests, integration tests, mocking strategies, and the overall test framework implementation.

## Key Files to Review
- `tests/run_tests.py`: Unified test runner
- `tests/mock_environment.py`: Dependency mocking utilities
- `tests/test_agents.py`: Agent unit tests
- `tests/test_workflow_integration.py`: Integration tests
- `tests/test_qa_agent_decisions.py`: Agent-specific logic tests
- `tests/test_memory_config.py`: Configuration tests
- `tests/test_outputs/`: Test output directory structure

## Additional Context
Testing multi-agent AI systems presents unique challenges due to the potentially non-deterministic nature of LLM outputs. A robust testing strategy should include deterministic mocks for LLM calls and external dependencies while verifying that the orchestration logic handles various output patterns correctly. The audit should focus on both unit testing of individual components and integration testing of the entire workflow.
